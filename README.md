# Data Science Challenge: Electroanatomical Mapping of the Heart

The electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for diagnosing heart conditions. However, the standard 12-lead ECG is insufficient for mapping out the heart's electrical activity in detail for various clinical applications, such as identifying the origins of an arrhythmia. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach that combines input from the standard 12-lead ECG with advanced machine learning techniques to reconstruct electroanatomical maps of the heart at clinically relevant resolutions.

## Task 1: Heartbeat Classification
Classify Heartbeats into Healthy and Irregular Categories using the ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset. 

In this task, we aim to classify heartbeats into two categories: healthy and irregular. By leveraging the ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset, we will explore binary classification techniques to diagnose irregular heartbeats accurately.

## Task 2: Irregular Heartbeat Classification
Diagnose Different Types of Irregular Heartbeats using the ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset.

Building upon the previous task, we will now delve into multiclass classification to diagnose various types of irregular heartbeats. The ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset will serve as a valuable resource for identifying different irregularities in heartbeat patterns.

## Task 3: Activation Map Reconstruction from ECG
Reconstruct Activation Maps of the Heart from ECG Data using the Dataset of Simulated Intracardiac Transmembrane Voltage Recordings and ECG Signals.

In this task, we aim to reconstruct a complete spatio-temporal activation map of the human heart. By utilizing advanced neural network models and sequences of ECG data, we can transform a sequence of length 12x500 into 75x1.

## Task 4: Transmembrane Potential Reconstruction from ECG
Reconstruct Transmembrane Potentials of the Heart from ECG Data using the Dataset of Simulated Intracardiac Transmembrane Voltage Recordings and ECG Signals.

Taking a step further, we will perform sequence-to-sequence prediction to reconstruct transmembrane potentials of the heart. By employing neural networks, we can transform a sequence of length 12x500 into 75x500, achieving more comprehensive insights into the heart's electrical activity.
